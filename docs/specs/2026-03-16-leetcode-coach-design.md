## Decision Registry

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| D1 | Fork SD Coach framework (Approach A) | Fastest path; proven teaching mechanics; YAGNI over shared framework extraction |
| D2 | NeetCode 150 Easy + Medium only | DevOps interviews rarely test Hard; Hard skipped but supported via jump-to mode |
| D3 | Add interview-common problems beyond NeetCode 150 | Real interviews draw from broader pool; ★ marks extra problems |
| D4 | Python as default language | User's background + interview speed advantage over Go |
| D5 | 4 Phases (not 18 categories) | Cleaner Phase Gates; categories are teaching units within Phases |
| D6 | 9-step Teaching Flow (A→I) | SD Coach's 8 steps + new Step E (optimal solution) |
| D7 | Brute → Optimal progressive solving | Core coding interview skill not needed in SD interviews |
| D8 | Complexity analysis as first-class citizen | Every solution requires Time + Space Big-O; integral to Steps D and E |
| D9 | Try-first-then-guide solving mode | Student attempts 5 min solo before Coach hints; most interview-realistic |
| D10 | Phase Gate = unseen problem, timed | Closest to real interview conditions |
| D11 | Feynman Transfer = variation + constraint change | Both types tested per problem |
| D12 | Study group jump-to mode | Not a separate mode; just router path to any specific problem |
| D13 | Problem Log in progress tracking | Per-problem record of approach, complexity, notes; SD Coach doesn't need this |
| D14 | Bilingual mode (English + Traditional Chinese) | User is non-native English speaker; bilingual for Feynman explanations, English Polish for interview prep |

## Teaching Flow (A → I)

### A. Review (3 min)

- Skip for the very first session
- Read `progress.md` → check **Mistake Registry** for ❌ Unresolved items
- "What Pattern did we cover yesterday? Summarize in one sentence."
- If unresolved mistakes → "Last time you struggled with [X]. Can you explain it now?"
- If `session_count - last_weekly_review >= 7` → run Weekly Review instead

### B. Read Problem (3 min)

- Display the problem: number, title, description, examples, constraints
- Guide student to identify: input/output types, constraints, edge cases
- "Before looking at any solution, what Pattern does this remind you of?"
- If student identifies correctly → acknowledge and move to C
- If wrong → don't correct yet, let them discover during Steps D-E

### C. Pattern Teaching (5 min)

- Explain the Pattern behind this problem using an analogy
  - Example: "Sliding Window is like a train window sliding across scenery — you only see what's inside the frame"
- Show the Pattern's **Python template** (pseudocode with blanks)
- Chunk Map: list 3-5 key concepts for this Pattern
- For each chunk → **lightweight Feynman check** (Recall only, no formal pass/fail): "Can you explain this in your own words?"
- Note: This is NOT the formal Feynman Gate. Step F is the formal gate with both Recall + Transfer + failure escalation.

### D. Brute Force (10 min) — NEW

- **Student tries solo for 5 minutes.** Coach does NOT intervene.
- If stuck → Coach gives ONE hint (not the answer)
  - Hint escalation: conceptual hint → example walkthrough → partial pseudocode
- Student describes approach in plain language FIRST → then translates to code
- Run through example cases to verify
- **Complexity analysis** (mandatory):
  - "What's the time complexity? Walk me through why."
  - "What's the space complexity?"
  - If wrong → guide to correct answer, don't just state it

### E. Optimal Solution (10 min) — NEW

- "Where's the bottleneck in your brute force? Which step is slowest?"
- Guide student to discover the optimization direction
- Student writes optimal solution code
- **Complexity analysis** (mandatory): Time O(?) + Space O(?)
- "Why does this Pattern reduce the complexity? What's the key insight?"
- If the brute force IS already optimal → skip this step, acknowledge it

### F. Feynman Gate (5 min)

**Stage 1 — Recall:** "Explain in your own words: what Pattern did this problem use and why?"
- Pass criteria: Captures the core idea, not just restating the solution

**Stage 2 — Transfer (BOTH types):**
1. **Variation:** "What if the problem changed to [variation]?"
   - Example: Valid Anagram → "What if you need to find ALL anagram starting indices in a string?"
2. **Constraint change:** "What if [constraint changes]?"
   - Example: "What if input is Unicode instead of lowercase English letters?"
- Pass criteria: Student can adapt their approach to the new scenario

**Failure Escalation (3 levels):** Same as SD Coach:
- Attempt 1-2: Reteach with different angle
- Attempt 3: Check prerequisites
- Attempt 4: Split into sub-concepts, mark 🔴

### G. Mock Interview (10 min)

- Coach gives a **related unseen problem**, timed
  - Source: Claude generates a variation of the current problem (similar pattern, different constraints/data types). NOT drawn from curriculum to avoid spoiling future problems.
- Student must think aloud + write code
- Feedback using **Tiered Scorecard** (see below)
- **Interviewer Follow-Up Preview:**
  ```
  In a real interview, they might ask:
    - "[specific follow-up about edge case]"
    - "[what if we change the constraint to X]"
  Think about these — I'll ask you next session.
  ```

### H. Notes (5 min)

- Write notes using Notes Template (read `references/notes-template.md`)
- Save to `notes/patternXX-problem-name.md`
- **Required sections:**
  - Pattern one-liner → sync to One-Liner Library
  - 🔴 Mistakes & Misconceptions (mandatory, challenge if student says "none")
  - 🎤 Interview Phrasing ("I'd approach this by...")
  - Complexity quick-ref: Brute O(?) → Optimal O(?)
- **Cross-Verification:** "After the session, look up this problem on NeetCode or LeetCode discussions. If you find a different approach, bring it up next session."

### I. Progress Update (2 min)

- Update `progress.md`:
  1. Update Topic Mastery (per Pattern) based on Gate + Drill performance
  2. Add entry to Problem Log (problem, approach, complexity, notes)
  3. Add scorecard result to Scorecard History
  4. Sync 🔴 mistakes to Mistake Registry
  5. Add one-liner to Pattern One-Liner Library
  6. Increment session count
  7. Clear Breakpoint section (session completed)
  8. Check if `session_count - last_weekly_review >= 7` → flag next session
- Preview tomorrow's problem
- If student leaves mid-session → write Breakpoint with current position

## Curriculum Structure

### Phase 0: Foundation Patterns

**Categories:** Arrays & Hashing, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Stack
**Problem count:** TBD — exact count determined when building curriculum.md by filtering NeetCode 150 Easy+Medium per category + interview extras. Category numbers in parentheses below are total NeetCode 150 counts (including Hard).

Phase Gate 0 → 1: One unseen Easy problem, 15 min, must produce working code. (Phase 0 does not require complexity analysis — that starts in Phase 1.)

### Phase 1: Core Data Structures

**Categories:** Binary Search, Linked List, Trees, Heap/Priority Queue
**Problem count:** TBD (Easy + Medium from NeetCode 150 + interview extras)

Phase Gate 1 → 2: One unseen Medium problem, 25 min, Scorecard ≥ 3/5.

### Phase 2: Advanced Algorithms

**Categories:** Backtracking, Tries, Graphs, Advanced Graphs
**Problem count:** TBD (Easy + Medium from NeetCode 150 + interview extras)

Phase Gate 2 → 3: One unseen Medium problem, 25 min, Scorecard ≥ 3/5.

### Phase 3: Optimization Techniques

**Categories:** 1-D DP, 2-D DP, Greedy, Intervals, Math & Geometry, Bit Manipulation
**Problem count:** TBD (Easy + Medium from NeetCode 150 + interview extras)

Final Gate: Mock interview — 2 Medium problems, 45 min, both Scorecard ≥ 5/7.

### Phase Gate Failure Protocol

```
Attempt 1: Fail
  → Identify 2-3 weakest Patterns from the attempt
  → Run targeted drill on each (Feynman Gate + practice problem)
  → Retry gate with a DIFFERENT unseen problem

Attempt 2: Fail
  → Run a full Weekly Review covering all Patterns in the Phase
  → Focus extra time on previously weak areas
  → Retry gate with a DIFFERENT unseen problem

Attempt 3: Fail
  → Show Progress Report to identify systemic weakness
  → Offer: "We can continue to the next Phase with a 🟡 flag on these
     Patterns, and I'll revisit them during Weekly Reviews. Or we can
     spend more time here. What do you prefer?"
  → Student decides — record choice in progress.md Phase Gate Results

## Weekly Review

### Trigger

Auto-triggered when Step A detects `session_count - last_weekly_review >= 7`.
Also triggered manually: "weekly review", "let's review", "recall drill".
Replaces normal session when triggered.

### Flow

1. **Pick 3 Patterns**: 1 from this week + 2 from past weeks (prioritize 🔴 and 🟡)
2. **Blind Recall**: Student explains each Pattern's key idea + template without notes
3. **Problem Recall**: Pick one solved problem from each Pattern → student walks through approach
4. **Mistake Registry Review**: Test all ❌ Unresolved. Resolved → ✅. Still stuck → re-drill.
5. **Quick Drill**: Re-drill the weakest Pattern
6. **Update progress.md**: Set last_weekly_review, update mastery levels

---

## Language Configuration

Ask the student their language preference at first session start.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **English** (default) | All teaching in English. Technical terms in English. |
| **Bilingual** | English for technical content, student's native language for Feynman-style plain explanations. Student can respond in either language. |

If bilingual mode is active:
- After each student response, provide a brief **English Polish**: a natural, interview-ready version of what they said
- Format: `💬 English Polish: "[polished version]"`
- Don't explain grammar — just show the improved version
- Especially valuable for non-native speakers preparing for English-language interviews

---

## Progress Report

### Trigger

- Student asks: "my progress", "how am I doing", "progress report"
- Automatically shown when passing a Phase Gate
- Shown during Weekly Review (abbreviated version)

### Format

Generate from `progress.md` data:

## Quick Start Router

When this skill activates:

**First, read `progress.md`** (if it exists).

### Routing

1. **No progress file** → New student. Ask language preference (confirm Python), run warm-up (solve a simple problem to gauge level), start Phase 0.
2. **Progress file has Breakpoint** → Resume. "Last time we stopped at [Step X] of [Problem]. Let's pick up there."
3. **Progress file, no breakpoint** → Returning student. Check Weekly Review trigger. If not due → next problem.
4. **Student says "I need to prepare [specific problem]"** → Jump to that problem. Follow normal A→I flow. Mark as jump-to in Problem Log.
5. **Student asks for mock interview** → Mock Interview mode.

### New Student Warm-Up

> "Before we start, let me see where you are. Can you solve this: Given an array of integers, return true if any value appears at least twice. Take 3 minutes."

Based on response:
- **Strong** (optimal approach, explains complexity) → skip first Easy problem per category in Phase 0, go straight to Mediums
- **Medium** (brute force, some structure) → follow Phase 0 curriculum as written
- **Struggles** (doesn't know where to start) → reassure, add extra Easy problems from interview extras pool before Mediums

## Pattern Cheatsheet (pattern-cheatsheet.md)

Quick reference for all 18 Patterns with Python templates. Example:

```markdown
### Sliding Window

**When to use:** Subarray/substring problems with contiguous elements
**Key signal:** "maximum/minimum subarray", "longest substring", "window of size k"

**Fixed-size template:**
def fixed_window(arr, k):
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    best = window_sum
    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        window_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k]
        best = max(best, window_sum)
    return best

**Dynamic-size template:**
def dynamic_window(s):
    left = 0
    seen = set()
    best = 0
    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in seen:
            seen.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        seen.add(s[right])
        best = max(best, right - left + 1)
    return best
```

## Step Mapping (SD Coach → LeetCode Coach)

For maintainers working on both skills:

```
SD Coach              LeetCode Coach         Notes
────────              ──────────────         ─────
Step A (Review)    →  Step A (Review)        Same
Step B (Intro)     →  Step B (Read Problem)  Adapted: concept intro → problem reading
Step C (Teaching)  →  Step C (Pattern)       Adapted: topic chunks → pattern template
Step D (PoC)       →  Step D (Brute Force)   NEW content: hands-on PoC → brute force solving
—                  →  Step E (Optimal)       NEW: no SD Coach equivalent
Step E (Simon)     →  (merged into Step F)   Simon drill merged into Feynman Gate
Step F (Interview) →  Step G (Mock)          Same concept, shifted letter
Step G (Notes)     →  Step H (Notes)         Same concept, shifted letter
Step H (Progress)  →  Step I (Progress)      Same concept, shifted letter

## What's NOT in Scope

| Item | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Hard problems | DevOps interviews don't test Hard; supported via jump-to only |
| Go language support | User chose Python for interviews; Go coach is a separate project |
| Automated LeetCode submission | Skill runs in Claude Code, not a browser extension |
| Framework extraction | YAGNI — extract when building third skill, not now |
| Spaced repetition algorithm | Weekly Review is sufficient; SRS adds complexity without proven benefit |
| Multi-user support | Single student tracking only |

## What Already Exists (Reused from SD Coach)

| Component | Reuse Level |
|-----------|------------|
| Session Router | Direct copy, change routing options |
| Feynman Gate (Recall + Failure Escalation) | Direct copy |
| Feynman Gate Transfer | Modified: variation + constraint change (was: compare/scenario/apply/counter) |
| Phase Gate structure | Direct copy, change exam format |
| Progress Tracking (Breakpoint, Mastery, Session Count) | Direct copy + add Problem Log |
| Mistake Registry | Direct copy |
| One-Liner Library → Pattern One-Liner Library | Rename + adapt |
| Weekly Review trigger + flow | Direct copy |
| Progress Report | Direct copy, add Pattern-level heatmap |
| Tiered Scorecard structure | Direct copy, change criteria |
| Notes Template structure | Direct copy + add complexity section |
| Teaching Flow (A→H) | Modified: 8→9 steps, add Steps D(brute) and E(optimal) |
| PoC Tiers → removed | Not applicable to LeetCode |
| Observability Mini → removed | SD-specific, not needed |
| 4-Step SD Framework → removed | Replaced by brute→optimal flow |

## New Patterns (Not in SD Coach)

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Brute → Optimal progressive solving | Core coding interview skill: find bottleneck, optimize, justify |
| Complexity analysis as first-class citizen | Every solution step requires Time + Space Big-O analysis |
| Problem Log | Per-problem tracking of approach, complexity, notes |
| Pattern Cheatsheet | Python templates for each of 18 patterns |
| Try-first-then-guide | 5 min solo attempt before Coach intervenes |
